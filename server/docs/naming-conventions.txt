Naming Conventions

classes:   UpperCamelCase
methods:   lowerCamelCase
variables: lower_snake_case
constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

functions: UpperCamelCase
  first upper is important to be able to name functions as reserved words, like Delete / delete
  given that any function can be a constructor, it's more uniform to use UpperCamelCase for classes and functions
